🧠 Technical Concepts

->SDK (Software Development Kit): Bundle of tools (CLI, libraries, runtime) required to build applications for a specific platform.​

->Foundations of .NET: Cross‑platform framework consisting of the CLR (runtime) and BCL (Base Class Library) for core functionality.​

->Java vs C#: Both are object‑oriented; Java targets the JVM, while C# targets the CLR and often receives language features faster (e.g., LINQ, async).​

->Compiler vs Interpreter: A compiler translates the whole program before execution (faster runtime), while an interpreter executes code line‑by‑line (simpler debugging).​



💻 C# Problem Solving

->Solved 10 logic problems in C# and pushed the solutions to the repository.

->Practiced 5 LeetCode problems.
