# 🧠 Technical Concepts



# SDK (Software Development Kit): Bundle of tools (CLI, libraries, runtime) required to build applications for a specific platform.

# Foundations of .NET: Cross-platform framework consisting of the CLR (runtime) and BCL (Base Class Library) for core functionality.

# Java vs C#: Both are object-oriented; Java targets the JVM, while C# targets the CLR and often receives language features faster (e.g., LINQ, async).

# Compiler vs Interpreter: A compiler translates the whole program before execution (faster runtime), while an interpreter executes code line-by-line (simpler debugging).

# 

# 💻 C# Problem Solving



# Solved 10 logic problems in C# and pushed the solutions to the repository.

# Practiced 5 LeetCode problems.
